To start the backend: 

```
cd backend
yarn install
yarn start
```

To start the frontend:

```
cd frontend
npm i
mpm run dev
```

I didn't add any tests as started running out of time. However I did partition the code so unit tests could easily be applied if required.
Hope you like Percy (one of my cats) :')
